# Welcome to otc-code contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project!

## How you can contribute

### Issues

If you spot a problem search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue within the repository.  Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone. 

If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix from a forked repository.

### Make Changes

If you found a solution for a problem or want to contribute new features, please fork the repository to your user account, conduct the changes and keep your fork up-to-date with our upstream repository.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR against our upstream repository.
Things to do when opening a Pull Request:

-   Explain in detail what you've changed and why.
-   Once you submit your PR, a codeowners team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request for additional information.
-   As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

### Review of PRs

What we will do:

-   We will create a new feature branch after reviewing your PR from the fork and we will merge to this new branch.
-   We will conduct tests to check if committed code from the feature branch will be able to be executed.
-   We will perform a rough check for eventual side effects of changes or newly introduced features to our reference architectures
-   If everything is ok, we will merge the feature branch to main and release a new version of the module.

### Your PR is merged!
